        <h2> What to pay attention to when drawing a portrait </h2>
          <p> There are a few important items to consider when trying to make a portrait realistic. You will want to spend a <b>lot</b> of time on the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Face shape</li>
            <li>Facial Proportions</li>
            <li>Shading/light source</li>
          </ul> 
          <p> 
            If you don't put a lot of care into the above 3 items, your drawing can easily start to look strange. 
            <strong> Compare with your reference photo often </strong> to make sure you're being accurate. 
          </p>

        <h3> Basic Steps </h3>
          <p> You can follow these steps in order to complete a portrait: </p>
          <ol>
            <li> Sketch face shape -- <em>Use <span> light pencils</span> so you can correct mistakes!</em></li>
            <li> Sketch facial features </li>
            <li> Compare with reference to make sure your sketch is accurate before continuing</li>
            <li> Using darker pencils, add shading to the facial features</li>
            <li> Shade the skin and hair</li>
            <li> Go over drawing with blending tool and/or eraser to make adjustments</li>
          </ol>
